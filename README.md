# Landscape Online Portal
## Description Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch
It seems like everything is on the internet nowadays. Surprisingly enough, however, most landscape firms do not have a client portal or any other online solutions. Most landscape firms still only accept cash! Thats where our new solution comes in. Our website will be built to primarily handle 3 things. Firstly, this website is designed for potential clients to view our firms portfolio of completed projects. Secondly, users can easily create an account to request a quote, and message our representatives directly. Finally, once a contract has been settled on, clients will be able to log into their account and pay securely using a secure digital payment method.
